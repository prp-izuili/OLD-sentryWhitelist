# OLD-sentryWhitelist
// THIS IS NOT REAL CODE. IT IS MADE FOR THE PURPOSES OF A ROLEPLAY. IF YOU TRY TO PUT THIS INTO A MACHINE I AM 99% SURE YOU ARE GOING TO FUCKING EXPLODE

Deprecated, but no public alternative has been released.
This code is being publicized for a single individual, but if anyone else comes across this then go ahead I guess.
Insert code in `main.src` at Line 821, except Lines 2 to 8, those must be inserted at the top of `main.src` along with the other libraries.

Target Acquisition is done by optics to identify a mercenary by their appearance, it is also done by pinging nearby ConTrackers and checking their owners in order to identify them if line of sight with their face is obscured.
Whitelist: Any Mercenary added to the whitelist will not be fired upon by connected Sentry Guns, regardless of affiliation. Useful for Mercenaries of non-rival teams.
Blacklist: Any Mercenary added to the blacklist will be fired upon by connected Sentry Guns, regardless of affiliation. Useful for traitors, or people you dont like.
